# Aspose App (aspose)

Barcode generator

### I use:
* Vue 3 with Composition API - since this is the best practice on Vue at the moment.
* Ui framework Quasar - because it has all the ui components which i need, and it is the best ui framework for me.

One of the weaknesses is that the source code size is too large for one page, but with the development of the project, this will be a big plus.


## Install the Global CLI
```bash
yarn global add @quasar/cli

## Install the dependencies

```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
# if you have the global CLI:
quasar dev

# otherwise:
yarn quasar dev
# or
npx quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```
